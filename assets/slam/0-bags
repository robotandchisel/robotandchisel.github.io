MAPPING EXPERIMENT BAG DATAFILES
Michael E. Ferguson

2010-08-08-create-ils.bag (3:14s, 4.8MB)
iRobot with Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01. Robot was driven from ILS doorway up 
hallway to CIFA lab, and back down to the ILS lab. This is a very simple 
dataset, default parameters work nearly OK with gmapping (some hallway 
shortening is seen).

2010-10-29-armadillo-cci.bag (3:24s, 12.8MB)
Vanadium Armadillo with Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01. Robot was driven up the hallway 
near the CCI student center, around an open area near the doorways, back down 
the hallway and into the CCI office. Another pretty simple dataset, default
parameters work fine with gmapping, some hallway shortening is typical. 
(Also includes cmd_vel and joystick output)

2010-10-29-armadillo-csdept.bag (5:56s, 19.1MB)
Vanadium Armadillo with Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01. Robot was driven around a medium
size loop in the SUNY Albany CS department. 
(Also includes cmd_vel and joystick output)

2010-12-11-neato-home.bag (5:28s, 8.8MB)
Neato XV-11 Robot and Laser. Short drive around a home. Forms a short loop.

2010-12-12-neato-ils.bag (4:48s, 6.9MB)
Neato XV-11 Robot and Laser. Robot was driven from my desk, out into the hall, 
through the lab, and back to the desk. 

2010-12-23-double-laser.bag (9:04s, 21.7MB)
Neato XV-11 Robot with laser (topic /base_scan), plus a Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 
(topic /hokuyo_scan) mounted above. Lasers are aligned fairly well in the plane.
