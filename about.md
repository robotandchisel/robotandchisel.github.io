<p class="message">
  I'm Michael Ferguson. I make robots do stuff, sometimes the things they do
  are even interesting. I have extensive experience in designing and working
  with the electronics, controls, sensors, perception and planning required to
  bring robotic hardware to life.<br />
  <br />
  Formerly CTO at Fetch Robotics, Founder/CTO at Unbounded Robotics and
  Founder at Vanadium Labs. I've also previously worked at Willow Garage.<br />
  <br />
  My personal robots have won numerous awards at the AAAI Robot Challenge,
  Trinity Fire Fighting Contest, Canadian National Robot Games, and RoboGames.
