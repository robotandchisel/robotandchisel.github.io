The first full batch of arbotiX prototypes is finally done after a summer of development and testing
with the 2 original prototypes (1 of which was used in IssyDunnYet, champion at Mech Warfare 2009).<br />
<br />
While prototype boards have gone out to early adopters, we're still working on some of the desktop
software. A V1.0 release of PyPose is expected around late September, or the same time that boards
should be available from Trossen Robotics.<br />
