It's finally here! PyPose V0.91 is a complete rewrite of the software, using wxPython as the GUI package.
It's world's better than the old release.<br />
<br />
One of the great new features is that we finally have a sequence engine.<br />
<br />
Features coming later this week (hopefully):<br />
<ul>
<li>Live sequence playback</li>
<li>Drop-down selection of serial ports</li>
<li>Pose &amp; Capture over a USBDynamixel</li>
<li>Encoders library</li>
</ul>

All of these features have been in the works for a bit, just need finishing touches. I'll also have a
video shortly walking through the whole process of creating poses and sequences to make a little
droid walker.
