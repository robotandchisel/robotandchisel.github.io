Our friend Andrew Alter, over at Trossen Robotics, has a bit of a servo fetish. He's the kind of guy
for whom AX-12+ servos are just not enough -- he has to have RX-28s and RX-64s -- he recently even
upgraded a number of his servos to the EX-106+ (you can read more about his robot Giger over
<a href="http://blog.trossenrobotics.com/2010/03/02/giger-v2-0-initial-walking-gait-progress/">here</a>).
Anyways, Andrew wanted to control some RX servos with his ArbotiX, and made that fact well known.<br />
<br />
It's often said that "you can't eat your cake and have it too" -- but we at Vanadium Labs don't like
idioms, because if we use them, our robots will too. What could be more annoying than a robot telling
you "There is no free lunch"? So, we decided that the ArbotiX had to now control RX servos -- and
that's exactly what our new RX-bridge can do! This little board plugs into your ArbotiX, transforming
it into the lowest cost RX controller on the market -- and you can still use your favorite apps like
PyPose/NUKE and the familiar Arduino IDE.<br />
<br />
P.S. You can see it all in action on Andrew's RX-64 based quadruped -- powered by NUKE:<br />
