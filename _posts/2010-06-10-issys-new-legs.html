One of the key features desired for Issy3 is a set of feet with tactile feedback. I've played with
FSR versions in the past, and they tend not to survive that long.<br />

Two afternoons of prototyping and printing has yielded the first of Issy's new feet. I have one leg
assembled, but I'll still have to get some different hardware tomorrow to tweak it completely.<br />

The foot consists of three printed parts: the outer case, the foot pad, and a retainer insert inside
the case. A screw connects throw the foot pad and the retainer, and a spring pushes the foot downward.
There will be a little spring steel connector on top that will get touched by the screw -- acting as
a simple switch. A vinyl footpad gives traction.<br />

Each foot takes about an hour of printing on the Makerbot.
