It has been over 5 years since I last posted on this blog - but now seems like a great time
to start posting things again!<br />
<br />
We will start with an update on Maxwell, my longest running robot, which originally started
as my Masters project at SUNY Albany. He's 9 years old now, although the only original parts
are the laser cut base, the drive motors, drive wheels, and the the neck:

I don't expect there are many hobby robots out there with such a long lifespan. Here is a
summary of Maxwell's evolution:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>January 2011 - <a href="http://www.showusyoursensors.com/2011/02/introducing-maxwell.html">Maxwell is created</a>
with an Arbotix, a series of EX-106 and RX-64 servos, Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 laser, a Kinect, and a massive Dell laptop.</li>
<li>March 2011 - <a href="http://www.showusyoursensors.com/2011/03/maxwell-gets-emergency-stop.html">Maxwell gets an
Emergency Stop</a>.</li>
<li>August 2011 - Maxwell wins the AAAI Small Scale Manipulation Challenge.</li>
<li>December 2011 - <a href="http://www.showusyoursensors.com/2011/12/maxwell-finally-gets-vertical-arm-lift.html">Maxwell
gets a vertical lift</a> so he can reach the ground and the table. Around the same time, the camera got upgraded to an
Asus Xtion.</li>
<li>Summer 2012 - Maxwell gets upgraded to a MX series servos. I also wrote a
<a href="https://www.servomagazine.com/magazine/contributor/michael_ferguson">three part article</a> about this in SERVO
magazine.</li>
<li>Summer 2013 - Maxwell gets upgraded to use MoveIt.</li>
<li>Fall 2014 - Maxwell gets upgraded to and
<a href="http://www.showusyoursensors.com/2014/09/intel-nuc-for-ros.html">Intel NUC</a> and the Etherbotix controller,
an ARM-based, Ethernet-connected replacement for the ArbotiX I was originally using. I also created lots of
<a href="https://github.com/mikeferguson/maxwell/tree/melodic-devel/maxwell/docs">documentation</a> so that Alan
Downing from HBRC could build a Maxwell clone (ROSwell)</li>
<li>Spring 2018 - Maxwell gets a parallel-jaw gripper (more on this below).</li>
<li>Spring 2020 - lots of updates.</li>
</ul>

The first of the new updates is migrating Maxwell to ROS Melodic. The drivers are all updated, and all the warnings
have been fixed. I've built a map of the house here in NH (and
<a href="https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_karto/issues/24">fixed a major bug</a> in slam_karto in the process):<br />

I've also updated Maxwell to the PS4 controller, since the PS3 doesn't work so great in newer versions of Linux
(this will be the subject of a later post).<br />
<br />
While the parallel-jaw gripper was physically installed on Maxwell some time ago, and the URDF had been updated,
I never actually finished the software to control the gripper -- that's the project for later this week. In the
meantime, here are some close up shots of the gripper:<br />
