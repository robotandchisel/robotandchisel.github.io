Next week is <a href="http://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/">National Robotics Week</a> and is
going to be quite a busy week for me. Maxwell will actually be touring the country for NRW this
year, making appearances at the following events:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/events/robot/">Trinity Fire Fighting Home Robot Contest </a>- Saturday April 9 and Sunday April 10th.</li>
<li><a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/node/6611">Stanford Robot Block Party</a> - Thursday April 14th</li>
<li><a href="http://robogames.net/">Robogames</a> - Friday April 15th to Sunday April 17th. Maxwell is entered
in the Best in Show category, as well as being featured in the Symposium.</li>
</ul>

Additionally, I'll be presenting a paper on a separate topic at the IEEE TePRA conference on Monday
and Tuesday the 11th/12th, while Maxwell is in transit across the country.<br />
<br />
I'll be trying to upload photos/recap as the week progresses.
