It's <a href="http://www.nationalroboticsweek.org/">National Robotics Week</a>! And apparently, there is just <i>TOO MUCH ROBOTICS</i> for just one standard week, because NRW spans 9 days, and the website lists events pretty much all month.<br /><br />There are a number of events in the Bay Area.&nbsp;First up is the <a href="http://www.svrobo.org/calendar/robot-block-party/">Robot Block Party</a> at Stanford from 1-6PM on Wednesday -- there are usually a ton of bots around in a somewhat&nbsp;impromptu&nbsp;show and tell. While I don't think I'll be pulling Maxwell out for this event, I'll probably be there for the later part of the event. Oh, and it's FREE.<br /><br />Also this week is an interesting event by on Thursday at SRI, put on by Xconomy: <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/san-francisco/2013/02/04/xconomy-forum-robots-remake-the-workplace/">Robots Remake the Workplace</a>. Including a keynotes speech from Rodney Brooks.<br /><br />April 19-21, it's <a href="http://robogames.net/">RoboGames</a>! Maxwell will be making an appearance there for sure, likely in the Silicon Valley HomeBrew Robotics Club booth.<br /><br />And finally, Maxwell will battle <a href="https://mattdowning.wordpress.com/2013/03/10/maker-faire-2013-entry-description/">PR-Lite</a> at MakerFaire 2013. In chess, that is. That's right, I've dusted off the old AAAI Chess code and the PR-Lite guys have been working to adapt it to their robot. I actually ran into some major issues upgrading the chess code to Groovy as many of the PCL nodelets were not ported forward during the catkinization. So, I took this as an opportunity to rewrite the whole board/piece detection pipeline into a single node that is way faster than the old one, taking into account a number of better heuristics.<br /><br />

I'm still working to integrate MoveIt instead of arm_navigation, but the current code is
posted now on <a href="https://github.com/mikeferguson/chessbox">github</a>.
