I've recently gotten a chance to play with MoveIt -- a new manipulation framework for ROS. MoveIt is the
replacement for arm_navigation in ROS Groovy and later. Like arm_navigation, MoveIt allows you to plan,
in collision free space, the movement of your robot arm. However, unlike arm_navigation, it was designed
from the ground up as a series of C++ libraries, with thin ROS wrappers, meaning it is far more extensible.<br />
<br />
In the past, I had wrapped arm_navigation's move_group with the simple_arm_server package, which allows
5-DOF arms, like Maxwell's to work with MoveIt. This time, I've taken the easy way out and just added a
6th degree of freedom, an upper arm roll:<br />

I had one extra MX-64 around, and printed a couple of brackets on a MakerBot Replicator (files are posted on
<a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:54586">Thingiverse</a>). With this extra servo, all of MoveIt pretty
much works out of the box. Once I wanted to control the real robot, I ran into a bit of issue. While I've
heard that you can use the PR2 controller manager plugin, I couldn't quite get the settings correct.
I therefore created a simpler version, which you can find in
<strike><a href="http://github.com/mikeferguson/maxwell">Maxwell's github</a> in the simple_moveit_plugins package</strike>
<i>(Update: the simple_controller_manager is now a part of MoveIt)</i>.
Here's a quick shot of RVIZ with the MoveIt plugin:<br />

While MoveIt is still version 0.3.20 something, it's actually pretty awesome.
