Trinity is just 6 days away. GMR is looking pretty good right now. Most of his code is completed,
he is completing 90% of his runs, with an average time of about 15-20s after bonuses and the room
factor.<br />
<br />
Overall, I only hit about half of my goals with this robot. The overall speed is only about half
as fast as I had originally wanted, but is still about 30% faster than LGM3 was at the Canadian
National Robot Games.  The room search is much faster and more reliable than LGM3 was, but I
really hope to still improve some other points.
