I've now get the Monte Carlo Localization turned on, map publishing working in ROS, and a number of
parameters defined. This required some hacking of the CoreSLAM library, in particular I removed all
of the references to differential drive odometry, instead loading odometry externally from TF.<br />
<br />
Here's an updated map using the 12-12-neato-ils bag file:<br />
<br />

<br />
There's still some work to fix the way that the map->odom transform is handled, and allow a
configurable map size and resolution (both of which will require reworking some more of the
underlying library). I'm hoping to have the code released shortly.
