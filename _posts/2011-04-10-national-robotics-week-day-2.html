Day 2 of National Robotics Week is over for me. I hit the Trinity Fire Fighting Contest
again this afternoon before continuing on to Boston. The guys from down at Shepard
University managed a third place in the Senior division, a real improvement of where
they were just two weeks ago at the ShepRobo fest. Congrats guys! We also got
Seth's mech walking.<br />
<br />
I've now made it to Boston for the TePRA conference. Interestingly, they are apparently
shutting off power to the hotel in a few hours.... although it is supposed to be back
in the morning. Upside: I got a free flashlight. Yay.<br />
<br />
In other robot news, the BSA has announced the
<a href="http://meritbadge.org/wiki/index.php/Robotics">official requirements</a>
for the long awaited Robotics merit badge.
