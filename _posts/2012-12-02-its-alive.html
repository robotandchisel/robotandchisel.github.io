Well, almost. I've finally started building my RoboMagellan entry for next year's RoboGames.<br />

Unlike many of the converted RC-trucks used for RoboMagellan, I'm building a differential drive base,
which should help with planning.<br />
<br />
I recently acquired a used UTM30-LX laser, which will be the primary sensor on this platform, along
with a pan and tilt camera, GPS, encoders, and an IMU. I'm planning to put the laser on a tilt stage
using an MX-28T servo, which should allow pretty serious 3D obstacle avoidance.
