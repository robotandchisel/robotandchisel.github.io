<i>Where to Buy Stuff, Part Two: </i><br />
<br />
There aren't a lot of places to get M2 hardware these days. Your local hardware store likely won't carry
it (most don't even carry #2-56 screws, 4-40 being the smallest they stock). Luckily, your hobby store
probably has them. The 1/18th scale car craze is great for us robot builders: a number of the models use
M2 hardware. The picture to the right shows Reaver's feet attached, using M2x4mm screws from a hobby
shop.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Reaver's feet, they look familiar, eh? Much of the SES stuff that doesnt specifically hold
servos, is compatible with Bioloid if you're creative. The Bioloid brackets hall have 5/8" x 5/8"
patterns, which align with many of the SES add-ons. Reaver is using a pair of BRAT feet, and I'm sure
everyone has noticed that Issy has SES tube-style legs.
