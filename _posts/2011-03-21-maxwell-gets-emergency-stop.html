I had ordered the emergency stop when I bought the first round of parts for Maxwell, but I hadn't
actually designed a location to attach it to on the robot. This weekend I rebuild a number of
components on Maxwell, installing a new base, upgrading the torso wiring harnesses, and installing
the E-stop (seen behind the arm, protected by the torso column):<br />
<br />

The E-stop is from <a href="http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?lang=en&site=US&WT.z_homepage_link=hp_go_button&KeyWords=a22e-m-01&x=0&y=0">Digikey</a>
and is the type it latches when pressed, such that you need to twist it to release and restart the
current flowing. <br />
<br />
Maxwell's ArbotiX is powered off the USB connection, allowing all 12V power to run through the E-Stop.
Pressing the E-Stop then stops all the motors and servos, while the ArbotiX continues to run and
interact with the PC. On releasing the E-stop, everything comes back to life nicely.
