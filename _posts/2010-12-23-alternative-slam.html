<i>gmapping</i> is the map building (SLAM) software most commonly used in ROS. It works very
well if you have a very high quality and long-range laser. The Neato laser is neither high
quality nor long range (and the low-cost Hokuyos, while fairly accurate, are still near-sighted).
There isn't a lot of academic literature that mentions low-cost lidars (unless it's a paper
about building a low cost module).<br />
<br />
One paper recently published that actually uses a short range Hokuyo is
<a href="http://openslam.org/coreslam.html">CoreSLAM</a>, a SLAM implementation in under
200 lines of code. Well..., the  map update/storage aspects are less than 200 lines of C
code, however the complete system relies on a bit more, namely a particle filter for
localization.<br />
<br />
It looked good. So I integrated it into ROS:<br />
<br />

<img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 320px;" src="/{{ site.baseurl }}assets/images/2010-12-23-map.png"/></a>
<br />
This map is currently only using odometry, I'm going to try and get the MCL localization
aspects working more tomorrow.  I also need to get the map_saver to work with my ROS
wrapper. I hope to have this on our SVN by the weekend.
