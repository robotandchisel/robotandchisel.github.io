The Nearly Universal Kinematics Engine (NUKE) is finally out in a first beta.  Right now
our templates only support 3DOF Lizard-legged 4 and 6 leg robots, however 3DOF Mammal-style
leg support isn't far off, and low DOF Biped support is in the works. This is the same system
that powered Issy, Roz, and Jeff to take the top 3 spots at CNRG's Walker Challenge. It takes
about 20-30 minutes to setup your bot once you get the hang of what's going on.<br />

NUKE is written in Python, and it exports a C/C++ Arduino project that runs on the ArbotiX.
NUKE can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/vanadiumlabs/pypose">GitHub</a>.
Documentation is also on that site.<br />
<br />
<strike>We also have a new google group for support (it's very new, hence the low traffic)
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/robocontroller">http://groups.google.com/group/robocontroller</a></strike>
Update: this group is pretty much inactive, visit the Trossen Robotics Forums.
