Robogames 2009 is now over. Both of my bots faired quite well.<br />
<br />
IssyDunnYet, my entry into the inaugural Mech Warfare event, won the gold medal. We didn't
ever get in a real ladder competition, too many bots had major issues, but Issy really did
quite well in all of his matches. I've posted a
<a href="http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/tutorials/build-articles-130/build-your-own-issydunnyet-3257/">
tutorial on how Issy was built</a>, over at
the Trossen Robotics Community.<br />

GMR made another appearance, taking second in the Fire Fighting Competition. I'm not too
disappointed about that second, he lost to a team from an Indonesian University. They
were greeted at home by the Minister of Education apparently. GMR was using a reworked
version of Crater's code, including head panning and all sorts of other audience pleasers...
