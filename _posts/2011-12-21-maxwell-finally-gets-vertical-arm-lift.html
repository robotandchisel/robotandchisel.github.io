I've been saying for quite some time that I wanted to add a vertical lift to Maxwell. Earlier this month,
he finally got that lift:<br />

The linear actuator gives the arm 20" of additional vertical mobility, making it possible to grab objects
at floor or table height, or hit most light switches. The lift is currently integrated into ROS arm_navigation,
I'll have some awesome videos soon.<br />
<br />
In addition to the arm upgrades, Maxwell recently got a new ASUS Xtion Pro Live to replace his Kinect.
The ASUS device requires only USB (no 12V power) and is significantly less heavy, reducing neck and back
stress (a common problem amongst aging robots). Speaking of aging robots, Maxwell turns one early next month.
