I've made quite a bit of progress on GMR. The motor mount plate is finished, the head is shaping up,
the controller board is finished. I've written all of the drivers for the new I2C devices, and I am
working on building the head board. I've still got to mount the caster, make the upper deck out of
EPVC, and mount all the sensors in their final positions.<br />
