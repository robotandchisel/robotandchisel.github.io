Unfortunately, there was a small delay in me posting anything from out on the West Coast. This was
for two reasons:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>The Internet connection at the hotel kinda sucked, this seems to be a recurring theme this month.</li>
<li>I was out far too late most nights with the Mech Warfare crowd.</li>
</ol>

I did manage to make it to the Stanford Robot Block Party this year. Maxwell did as well. At least in
pieces. The battery strap broke during shipment (into about 6 pieces), requiring Maxwell be opened
up for repairs:<br />

Overall the sliding battery didn't do much damage, breaking only the charge connector and yanking a few wires.
It took about 25 minutes to correct things and then Maxwell took a tour around the facility.<br />
<br />
We set up with the Home Brew Robotics Club guys, and next to Pi Robot:<br />
