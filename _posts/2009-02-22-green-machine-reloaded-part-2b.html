There's always gonna be some setbacks... such as the robot falls over when it comes to a stop.
Or that you mounted the IR sensors at a 45 degree angle rather than 60 degrees. And occasionally,
you find out your bot likes to climb the wall.. I really wish a video camera was running right
then.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm quickly changing the lower frame to move the battery backwards 1/2", move the motors
up about 1", and put smaller wheels on. I'm also not entirely sold on this TPA-81 thermopile
nonsense... its really kinda slow compared to some good old IR photodiodes... or a pyroelectric.
