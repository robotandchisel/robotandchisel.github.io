Recently, I rebuilt Maxwell's base using a new design which allows the front plate to drop down
for easy access to the ArbotiX2 prototype being used in Maxwell:<br />

<br />
Here you can see the ArbotiX2 with dual 30A motor driver board. On the left is a step-up/down
regulator for the Kinect, this takes 9-18VDC and outputs 12VDC@1.25A. The back area of the
base is pretty much unchanged, housing the SLA battery and power terminals as seen in the
