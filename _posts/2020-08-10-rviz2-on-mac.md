Back in 2014 or so, I had ROS1 running on my Mac. It took me a couple days to
install and build dependencies. It was quite unstable. This weekend I got a new
Macbook Pro (to replace my 2016 Macbook Pro, you know, the one with that
[_great keyboard_](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/01/an-ode-to-apples-awful-mac-keyboard/)).
I decided to also try setting up ROS2 on it, mainly for native RVIZ.
It turned out to be _somewhat_ straight-forward.

As a note, I really didn't want to do too much mangling of my very nice and
very new Macbook Pro - so I actually haven't disabled
[System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899). So
far everything is working (with some caveats on workflow noted below).

First off, newer Macbooks are running Catalina (OSX 10.15) - which is not a
supported release. ROS2 (even the newest Foxy release) still targets OSX 10.14
Mojave. This means we absolutely have to build from source for Catalina.
I started by following the
[from-source installation instructions](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Installation/Foxy/macOS-Development-Setup/).
I'd suggest going through the dependency installations listed there and
then applying the patches in the next several sections of this post
BEFORE actually running the <code>colcon</code> commands to build anything.

## Installing XCode

The ROS2 instructions work for installing the XCode command line utilities,
but it seems that I also needed to install XCode from the App store AND start
the XCode GUI in order to finish the installation.

## Some Paths

I had to add the following to my <code>~/.zshrc</code> to get the various
visual tools to compile:

    export Qt5_DIR=/usr/local/opt/qt5/lib/cmake
    export PATH=/usr/local/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH

## The end of /usr/include

One of the bigger changes in MacOSX Catalina is the removal of
<code>/usr/include</code>. Apparently the files have mostly moved to
<code>/Library/Developer</code>. As far as I could tell, this really only
affects the OGRE build - which needs access to various system header files.
The fix is to set <code>CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT</code>:

```
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
```

I still had some build issues due to missing <code>CoreFoundation</code>,
which were fixed by this hack:

```
sudo cp /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/Headers/* /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.15.sdk/usr/include/CoreFoundation
```

## RVIZ Crashes

I was super excited to see a laser scan show up on my Macbook! I then decided
to disable the laser scan and check out some other data - but RVIZ immediately
crashed. I spent a while debugging (even after looking through the issues
on GitHub) before realizing the fix I had come up with was already merged into
the <code>ros2</code> branch, but not the foxy branch I was building. You'll
want to run from the <code>ros2</code> branch or at least include
[PR #572](https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/572) to really be able to use
RVIZ at all in MacOSX.

## RQT Issues

Next I tried to run <code>rqt_console</code> - it wouldn't run, giving me some
crazy trace about not finding RMW implements - but I had already tested the
Python demo nodes, so I knew that things were working there.

I eventually determined that I could run <code>rqt</code> and then load the
desired plugin. I haven't gone back and debugged this more yet.

## Autocomplete Issues

When I first installed things, I got the following warning when sourcing
my workspace:

```
fergs@MacBook-Pro foxy % source install/setup.zsh
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
```

I accepted the insecure directories a number of times, but eventually got
frustrated that autocomplete seemed to not be working. Finally, I started
looking into it:

```
fergs@MacBook-Pro foxy % compaudit
There are insecure directories:
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
/usr/local/share/zsh
```

Apparently the fix is quite simple. From
[stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13762280/zsh-compinit-insecure-directories):

```
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/local/share/zsh
```

## Debugging with SIP Enabled

One challenge I did come across was that you can't just run <code>lldb</code>
with ROS2 due to System Integrity Protection enabled. This is because the
default <code>lldb</code> executable is located in one of those key system
folders and so it strips off all the <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> stuff.
The workaround is actually pretty simple - use a different lldb, for instance:

```
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/lldb ~/foxy/install/rviz2/bin/rviz2
```

## Remaining Issues

There are still a few issues to resolve:

 * Dark mode has some issues - but I've [opened a PR for that](https://github.com/ros2/rviz/pull/590).
 * RQT tools not loading without starting rqt first and selecting plugin
   really slows down workflow. This one might actually be related to still
   having System Integrity Protection enabled?
