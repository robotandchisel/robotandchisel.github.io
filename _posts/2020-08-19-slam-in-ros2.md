Now that the drivers are pretty much operational for the UBR-1 robot under ROS2,
I'm starting to work on the higher level applications. The first step was building
a map and setting up localization against that map.

## SLAM

In ROS1 there were several different Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
packages that could be used to build a map: gmapping, karto, cartographer, and
slam_toolbox. In ROS2, there was an early port of cartographer, but it is really not
maintained. The other package that has been ported to ROS2 is <code>slam_toolbox</code>,
which is basically <code>slam_karto</code> on steroids - the core scan matcher is
the same, but everything else has been rewritten and upgraded.

Installation of slam_toolbox is super easy:

    sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-slam-toolbox

I then created a launch file, which is an updated version of the <code>online_sync_launch.py</code>
found within [slam_toolbox](https://github.com/SteveMacenski/slam_toolbox):

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch.actions import DeclareLaunchArgument
from launch.substitutions import LaunchConfiguration
from launch_ros.actions import Node
from ament_index_python.packages import get_package_share_directory


def generate_launch_description():
    use_sim_time = LaunchConfiguration('use_sim_time')

    declare_use_sim_time_argument = DeclareLaunchArgument(
        'use_sim_time',
        default_value='false',
        description='Use simulation/Gazebo clock')

    start_sync_slam_toolbox_node = Node(
        parameters=[
          get_package_share_directory("ubr1_navigation") + '/config/mapper_params_online_sync.yaml',
          {'use_sim_time': use_sim_time}
        ],
        package='slam_toolbox',
        node_executable='sync_slam_toolbox_node',
        name='slam_toolbox',
        output='screen')

    ld = LaunchDescription()

    ld.add_action(declare_use_sim_time_argument)
    ld.add_action(start_sync_slam_toolbox_node)

    return ld
```

My updates were basically just to use my own config.yaml file. In that YAML file
I had to update the frame ids (I don't use a base_footprint, and my robot has a
_base_scan_ topic rather than _scan_). There are dozens of parameters to the
Karto scan matcher and you can see the entire file
[on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeferguson/ubr_reloaded/blob/ros2/ubr1_navigation/config/mapper_params_online_sync.yaml)
but the basic changes I had to make were:

```yaml
slam_toolbox:
  ros__parameters:

    # ROS Parameters
    odom_frame: odom
    map_frame: map
    base_frame: base_link
    scan_topic: /base_scan
```

Now we can run the launch file and drive the robot around to build a map.
We can also view the map in RVIZ. To get the map to come through, you will
likely have to expand the options under the _topic name_ and change
the _durability_ to _transient local_. Even though the documentation
on [ROS2 QoS](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/About-Quality-of-Service-Settings/#qos-compatibilities)
says that _volatile_ subscriber is compatible with a _transient local_
publisher, I've found it doesn't always seem to work right:

</center>

Now that we've built a map, it is time to save the map. The command is
quite similar to ROS1, except you _must_ pass the base name of the map
(so here, I'm passing map, which means it will save map.yaml and map.pgm
in the local directory):

```
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f map
```

Next we can create a launch file to display the map - I used the example
in [nav2_bringup](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/blob/main/nav2_bringup/bringup/launch/localization_launch.py)
as my starting place and changed which package the map was stored in.
You can find my launch file in the
[ubr1_navigation package](https://github.com/mikeferguson/ubr_reloaded/blob/ros2/ubr1_navigation/launch/localization.launch.py).
I started my localization launch file and opened RVIZ to find:

<center>
<img src="/{{ site.baseurl }}assets/images/2020-08-19-map-bad.png" width="90%" />
</center>

It turned out I had to adjust the <code>free_thresh</code> threshold in the
map.yaml down to 0.196 (the same value in ROS1) for the map to look correct:

</center>

There are numerous parameters in <code>slam_toolbox</code> and many more features
than I could possibly cover here. For a good introduction, check out

## Localization

While there are a variety of mapping options in ROS1 and some in ROS2, for localization
it really is just Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL). There is some 
[ongoing work](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2/issues/1391)
towards more modern localization solutions in ROS2, but it would seem to be
a long way off.

The launch file we copied over for running the map_server also included AMCL
in it (hence the name localization.launch.py).

For the most part, there are only a few parameters to tune in AMCL to generally
get decent results:

```yaml
amcl:
  ros__parameters:
    alpha1: 0.25
    alpha2: 0.2
    alpha3: 0.15
    alpha4: 0.2
    base_frame_id: "base_link"
    global_frame_id: "map"
    laser_model_type: "likelihood_field"
    max_beams: 60
    max_particles: 2000
    min_particles: 500
    odom_frame_id: "odom"
    robot_model_type: "differential"
    tf_broadcast: true
    z_hit: 0.6
    z_max: 0.05
    z_rand: 0.3
    z_short: 0.05
```

Before trying to tune AMCL, you really need to make sure your TF and odometry
are setup correctly, there are some points in the
[Navigation Tuning Guide](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/Navigation%20Tuning%20Guide),
which was written for ROS1, but is generally very much true in ROS2.

The most important parameters are setting the _alphaX_ parameters to model your
odometry noise. By default all of them are set to 0.2, but they should be adjusted
based on the quality of your odometry:

 * alpha1 - noise in rotation from rotational motion
 * alpha2 - noise in rotation from translational motion
 * alpha3 - noise in translation from translational motion
 * alpha4 - noise in translation from rotational motion

These are somewhat intuitive to understand. For most robots, if they drive forward in
a straight line, the odometry is very accurate - thus _alpha3_ is often the lowest value
parameter. When the robot turns in place, it probably has more noise (unless you have
a fantastically tuned gyro being merged with the wheel odometry) - so _alpha1_ often
gets bumped up. My _alpha1_ is currently set high since I have not yet integrated
the IMU on the UBR-1 into the ROS2 odometry.

When the _alpha_ parameters are set too low, the odometry ends up driving the
distribution of particles in the cloud more than the scan matcher. If your odometry
is inaccurate, the robot will slowly get delocalized because the particle distribution
lacks particles located at the true pose of the robot.

If the _alpha_ parameters are set too high, the particle distribution spreads out
and can induce noise in your pose estimate (and cause delocalization).

One of the best ways to test these parameters is in RVIZ. Add your laser scan to the
display, and set the fixed frame of RVIZ to your map frame. Then turn the
"Decay Time" of the laser way up (20-100 seconds). If your parameters are correct,
the laser scans will all line up very well. If the parameters are crap, the
walls raycast by the laser scanner will be very "thick" or unaligned.

To tune these parameters, I will often drop all of them lower than the default,
usually something like 0.05 to 0.1 for each parameter.

A final check is to display the <code>/particlecloud</code> published by AMCL and
make sure it isn't diverging too much - if it is, you might have to reduce your
_alpha_ parameters. To see the particle cloud, you'll have to switch the QoS to
_best effort_. The image below shows what the cloud looks like when the robot is
first localized, it should be a lot less spread out during normal operation:
