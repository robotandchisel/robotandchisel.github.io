<i>This is day 2 of my 2020 <a href="/{{ site.baseurl }}tag/national-robotics-week/"">National
Robotics Week</a> blog marathon! I've added a new label for
<a href="/{{ site.baseurl }}tag/blast-from-the-past">Blast From The Past</a> posts, of which
this pretty much qualifies.</i><br />
<br />
I've recently been sorting through some older electronics and came across this:<br />

<br />
This is the original ArbotiX prototype. Back in 2009, I was a fairly active member of
the Trossen Robotics forums. Andrew Alter had this new little event he called Mech
Warfare that they were putting on at RoboGames.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall having my first ever phone call with Andrew Alter, and by time it
was over having a) signed up to build a scoring system and b) bought a Bioloid kit.
I did not promise to show up with a Mech because there was really pretty limited time
to work on that during the semester.<br />
<br />
Then I showed up with a Mech. And won.<br />
<br />
You can read all about how I build IssyDunnYet in the thread over at
<a href="http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/showthread.php?3282-Issydunnyet-(A-mech)&amp;highlight=issydunnyet">Trossen Robotics</a>.
But this post is about the evolution of the ArbotiX.<br />

The original ArbotiX is really pretty simple, it is an Arduino-based board with hardware
support for Dynamixel control and XBEE communications, but the Python-based pose engine,
and open source nature, really opened up what you could do with Dynamixel Servos. ArbotiX
boards have been used in so many places over the past decade+, everything from
<a href="https://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">Giant Hexapods</a> to
<a href="http://blog.trossenrobotics.com/2014/03/18/core-studios-robotic-kinetic-sculpture/">Kinematic Sculptures</a>.<br />
<br />
The original boards were all through hole parts because I was literally assembling these
by hand while working my way through grad school. When the order quantities got high enough,
I actually had the board fab guys assemble the parts in China and then I would insert the
expensive DIP chips stateside. Eventually, I finished grad school and took a job at Willow
Garage - at that point we handed all manufacturing over to Trossen Robotics and wound down
Vanadium Labs. Trossen is still selling lots of these little boards today, although they've
gone surface mount with the newer ArbotiX-M.<br />

Also found in my pile of random old boards was the original hand-build prototype of the
ArbotiX Commander. It looks quite a bit different from the
<a href="https://www.trossenrobotics.com/p/arbotix-commander-gamepad-v2.aspx">current generation</a>.<br />

I also came across the spiritual predecessor to the whole ArbotiX lineup, the AVRRA board
(AVR Robotics API). This was used in
<a href="http://forums.trossenrobotics.com/showthread.php?1757-Xr-B3-My-latest-robot&amp;highlight=">XR-B3</a>
(pretty much my last non-ROS bot).<br />
