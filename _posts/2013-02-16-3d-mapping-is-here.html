It's just about 2 years since Willow Garage ran the <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/openni/Contests/ROS%203D">ROS 3D</a>
contest to see what the community could come up with for Kinect/OpenNI applications. The full results are
<a href="http://www.ros.org/news/2011/02/ros-3d-contest-the-results.html">here</a>. The winner in the "most useful"
category was a 3D SLAM application called RGBDSLAM. I remember trying to get it running, I eventually did,
but it was not easy.<br />
<br />
Just this past week I saw a post from the guys over at CCNY, showing off their new
<a href="http://ros.org/wiki/ccny_rgbd">visual odometry and keyframe (offiline) mapping system</a>. I decided to
give it a try... and it worked out of the box no problem. Here's a video CCNY posted:<br />

A few days later I came across a video (and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/rtabmap/">code with ROS wrappers</a>)
from IntRoLab at Sherbrooke:<br />

I also have noticed that <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/rgbdslam">RGBDSLAM</a> is still getting updates and
documentation revisions, so it is still getting active improvements.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking it would be really cool to put together an application that turn these 3d maps into 2d maps usable
by the ROS navigation stack. Robots like <a href="http://turtlebot.com/">TurtleBot</a> can typically localize
against a map with just their Kinect-like sensor, but building maps has traditionally been tough due to the
lack of features visible in a 57-degree wide "fake-laserscan".<br />
<br />
This is really awesome stuff for the robotics community -- we have at least 3 different 3D mapping applications
released into the ROS ecosphere. Are there more out there that anyone knows of? If you've used these apps,
feel free to comment!
