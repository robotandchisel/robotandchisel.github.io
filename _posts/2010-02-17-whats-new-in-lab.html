It's been a busy month, and the lack of updates here is a testament to that. Over the past month,
Vanadium has released two new products, and has another on the way. The MINI RoboController has
been on shelves for a few weeks at Trossen, and the ArbotiX Commander should be in stock later this
week.<br />

<br />
We also purchased a MakerBot, which is now up and running. This little guy will be producing robot
parts soon, as I have a number of projects on the backlog that I want to get going.<br />
<br />
As for that product on the way: how about controlling some RX-64 servos with your ArbotiX? You'll
be able to do just that with our new RX-Bridge, a little add-on board for the ArbotiX that converts
it from an AX-12 controller, to an RX-series controller (and EX-106's too).<br />
<br />
Lastly, we've been hard at working testing, and the V1.1 release of PyPose/NUKE is just around the
corner. Should be out very shortly, with a number of improvements and bug-fixes. Unfortunately,
mammal-style IK will be held over until v1.2.
