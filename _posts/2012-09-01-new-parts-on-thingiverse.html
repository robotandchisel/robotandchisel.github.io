It has been a while since I've posted to this blog, I'll avoid making the typical
"that's about to change comment".<br />
<br />
I do want to post links to a few relevant parts that I've uploaded to Thingiverse today.
These are kinda old, but never got shared, and since our MakerBot PC almost died this
week, I decided I had better get them out there before I lose them. Without further ado:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The Asus Xtion <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11442">"wide"-style Bioloid-frame mount</a>
is now posted. This is the mount that I have been using on Maxwell for almost a year, and is much more
stable side-to-side than previous designs.</li>
<li>An <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:29590">8020 adapter</a> for mounting tall masts on
TurtleBots.</li>
<li>Finally, I've uploaded the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:11193">style-ized version</a>
of the TurtleBot gripper. These are tough to print, due to the overhang, but look pretty cool.</li>
</ul>
