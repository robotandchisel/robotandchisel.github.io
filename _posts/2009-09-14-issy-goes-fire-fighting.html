I've been talking lately about building a walking fire fighter, but I've now finally started
transforming Issy from a mech into a Fire Fighter.<br />
<br />
Issy's new body is about 2" shorter in both the width and length direction, a necessary adjustment
to get him under the 12"x12" rule (yes, I know the Trinity contest allows walkers to be 12"x18",
but I intend to take Issy to CNRG, and possibly RoboGames next year, and neither contest has a
walker division, so the 12"x12" rule had to be followed).<br />
<br />
Issy has a head similar to what I had on GMR. The head has an IR ranger for 99% of his navigation,
a sonar ranger mainly for approaching the candle (since the IR gets wiped out), an IR photodiode
for fire detection (similar to Crater's sensory), and a ducted fan for fire extinguishing. Issy
is sporting a new <a href="http://www.vanadiumlabs.com/arbotix">arbotiX robocontroller</a>, and
power is from an 11.1V 2200mAh LiPO. Early tests with IK have shown quite a bit of promise as
far as odometry from walking - I've still got a ways to go as far as implementing a geometrically
stable gait.<br />
<br />
Issy's code will basically be another rework of Crater's (cause heck, it works).
