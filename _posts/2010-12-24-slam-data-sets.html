Over the past semester I've been spending a lot of time working with low-cost SLAM. In doing so,
I've collected a number of datasets around the Albany campus. I've uploaded a number of them
(as ROS bag files), along with sample maps, to my server:
<a href="http://www.fergy.me/slam">http://www.fergy.me/slam</a>. All are free to use these
datasets for whatever they please -- however,  please post back maps and algorithms/parameters
used to create them. Over time I would like to develop a set of best-known algorithms/parameters
for low-cost SLAM.<br />
<br />
These datasets were collected on iRobot Creates, the Neato XV-11, and the Vanadium Armadillo
using the Neato Laser or the Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01. In particular, I've recently collected a
dataset I really am looking forward to working with: the 2010-12-23-double-laser.bag dataset,
which consists of a long route around the ILS lab with a Neato XV-11. I mounted a second
laser on the Neato for this run, a Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01 sensor, which is aligned with the
Neato laser from above:<br />
