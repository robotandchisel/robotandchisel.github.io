I've posted a number of 'teaser' pictures along the way, of my latest bot coming together. So here she is:
Sally, a salamander-inspired robot. Here's a video of her first steps:<br />

Over the next several months I'll be working on her kinematics and weight distribution to make the walking
more refined. And for anyone scared: No reavers were hurt (or disassembled) during the construction of this
robot...<br />
<br />
On other fronts, CNRG is just 2 weeks away -- but Issy is almost ready for fire fighting... video soon.
