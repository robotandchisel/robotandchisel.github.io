After the Little Green Machine won the Canadian National Robot Games last month, I have turned
my attention to the 2009 Trinity Fire Fighting Robot Contest. While LGM could probably just be
rolled back out and run, I'm instead rebuilding a new robot from the ground up - the Green
Machine Reloaded (GMR).<br />
<br />
GMR will use the same motors, encoders, and power system that LGM used. The 4 IR rangers are
also in a similar configuration. The improvements for this version are numerous: GMR is 45%
smaller, has a panning heading with 300 degrees of movement, 3-7/8" Banebots wheels, and
replaces the old Eltec pyroelectric sensor with a TPA81 thermopile. The brain has been
upgraded from a Barello ARC board with an ATMEGA16 to my new AVRRA Lite board, sporting an
ATMEGA324, XBEE wireless, and onboard connectors for the AX-12 servo.<br />
<br />
The controller PCB is currently being manufactured. I've completed the lower frame components,
and am currently working on assembly of the base of the robot. I hope to have a fully functional
bot by the end of January.
